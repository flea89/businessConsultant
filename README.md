ExpressJs and AngularJs are becoming two important realities in the web panorama and this personal project is born from the intention
of trying to bind the potentials of these two "libraries" and make it work together.<br>
The work started by trying to "build" a seed, in order have a good directive structure and in particular to have grunt, bower and 
tests to work properly.
